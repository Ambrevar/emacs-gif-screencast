;;; Commentary:
;; Call `gif-screencast' to start a recording.
;;
;; A screenshot is taken for every user action.
;;
;; Call `gif-screencast-stop' (<f9> by default) to finish recording and create
;; the GIF result.

;;; Code:

;; TODO: Capture on scrolling (e.g. program outputting to Eshell buffer).
;; TODO: Add support for on-screen keystroke display, e.g. screenkey.
